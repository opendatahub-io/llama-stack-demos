A `kustomization.yaml` file exists to launch all required Kubernetes objects for the scenarios defined in the repository. To create run the following.

## Running Demos and Notebooks

This project uses `uv` as its package manager for the python based notebooks and demo scripts. You can quickly set up your working environment by following these steps:

1) `pip install uv`
2)  `uv sync`
3) `source .venv/bin/activate`

Once you are using the virtual environment, you should be good to run any script in `app/src`.
